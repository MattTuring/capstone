<div class="defintion">
<h3>Blockchain</h3>
<p>It is a record system for data. All data is defined at the start of the chain and rules for issuing data. Data ownership can be transfered to new owners, but new data cannot be created. As of now, all transactions pertaining to the data are public (with one or two exceptions).</p>
</div>
<div class="defintion">
<h3>Centralised versus decentralised systems</h3>
<p>A centralised system is one in which a central controller exercises control over the lower-level components of the system directly or through the use of a power hierarchy. <br/> <br/>A decentralised system, on the other hand, is one in which complex behaviour emerges through the work of lower level components operating on local information, not the instructions of any commanding influence.</p>
</div>
<div class="defintion">
<h3>Block</h3>
<p>A block is a batch of transactions grouped together into a package, the blockchain network takes in the bloack and adds it onto the chain of previous transactions to update the blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div class="defintion">
<h3>Mining</h3>
<p>The process of adding the block of transactions ot chain as well as issuing more currecny in exchange for someone adding transactions to the chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="defintion">
<h3>Cryptocurreny</h3>
<p>Each blockchain holds a native asset, generally known as a cryptocurreny. Every cryptocurreny has a unique purpose, design, or consensus algorithm (the rules used to do the accounting.) </p>
</div>
<div class="defintion">
<h3>DApp</h3>
<p>DApp is an abbreviated form for decentralized application. A DApp has its backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Contrast this with an app where the backend code is running on centralized servers.</p>

<h3>Bitcoin: The Grandfather of Cryptocurreny</h3>
<p>
Bitcoin was invented by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and was released as open-source software in 2009. In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John's pizzas for â‚¿10,000 or about 205 Million USD as current valuation. The overwhelming majority of bitcoin transactions take place on a cryptocurrency exchange, rather than being used in transactions with merchants. Delays processing payments through the blockchain of about ten minutes make bitcoin use very difficult in a retail setting. Prices are not usually quoted in units of bitcoin and many trades involve one, or sometimes two, conversions into conventional currencies. Merchants that do accept bitcoin payments may use payment service providers to perform the conversions. The price of bitcoins has gone through cycles of appreciation and depreciation referred to by some as bubbles and busts.</p>
<p>Because of bitcoin's decentralized nature and its trading on online exchanges located in many countries, regulation of bitcoin has been difficult. However, the use of bitcoin can be criminalized.</p>

<h3>Ethereum: King of the Dapps</h3>
<p>Ethereum provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts. The virtual machine is what is used to run the DApps. Every transaction uses the native blockchain asset known as Ether. The other main difference between Bitcoin is that the supply of the chain asset is currently uncapped. There are plans to limit the supply in the future but no concrete action has been taken. The fees to use the network are determined by the complexitiy of the transaction.</p>

<h3>Ripple: The Banking Coin</h3>

<p>Ripple has been adopted by banks and payment networks as settlement infrastructure technology. Ripple relies on a common shared ledger, which is a distributed database storing information about all Ripple accounts. The network is "managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records." Servers could belong to anyone, including banks or market makers. Ripple validates accounts and balances instantly for payment transmission and delivers payment notification with very little latency (within a few seconds). Payments are irreversible, and there are no chargebacks.</p>
<p>A unique feature is that the total supply of the currecny decreases with each use.</p>
